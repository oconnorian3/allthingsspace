# Bugs #

*Solved Problems*

   * The background in the about us section caused the about us header to become unreadable. Creating a darker backgrouynd solved this
   * On a smaller screen a bit white space formed between the about us section and the main video banner. This was becasue I had a heigth deine for the video and removing this fixed it.
